00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
dance till you drop is like monty
 


00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
python's ministry of silly walks
 


00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
meets just dance so first and foremost
 


00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's an online game you can go log in
 


00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
everything is powered by firebase
 


00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
authentication on the profile page we
 


00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
can go use the the picture
 


00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:15.759 align:start position:0%
via cloud storage everything else gets
 


00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
stored to firestore
 


00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
you can go test it out on the website
 


00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
everything's fully featured so if we go
 


00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
over to play the first thing we're going
 


00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
to need to do is we're going to need to
 


00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
connect a camera
 


00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
so we can either directly connect the
 


00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
computer webcam or
 


00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
we can click here it'll generate a qr
 


00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 align:start position:0%
code which we scan with the flutter app
 


00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
which goes to
 


00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
the google kubernetes engine via
 


00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
websocket then back to the front end so
 


00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
we get the image over here
 


00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
so we're just going to use the um
 


00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
computer camera so we're going to click
 


00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
calibrate camera
 


00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
now the great thing about why we're
 


00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
calibrating this is that we can go
 


00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
generate dance moves
 


00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
and retrofit other types of dance moves
 


00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 align:start position:0%
that have already been generated
 


00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.910 align:start position:0%
to your body dimensions in terms of the
proportions


00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
now we can then go through and we can go
 


00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
select either a pre-existing dance
 


00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
this will be something that you can
 


00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
either download or record in the future
 


00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
or we can enter dance party mode where
 


00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.429 align:start position:0%
all of the dance moves are randomly
generated



00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
human-esque figures that you try and
 


00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
match so we can go through and we can
 


00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
start the dance party
 


00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
and as you can see the blue figure is
 


00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
where you're currently at
 


00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
and the white figure is the dance move
 


00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
that you're trying to mimic note that
 



00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
the white figure
 


00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
always anchors to your left shoulder so
 


00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter where you are in the
 


00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
the space that you're in
 


00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
as long as you get your body into the
 


00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
right shape it will go count it for you
 


00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
now if we go through and we close out if
 


00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
we want to go through we can go choose
 


00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
another dance really easily without
 


00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
needing to go recalibrate or anything
 


00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 align:start position:0%
and not only can we select a dance up
 


00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
here but we can also change the speed
 


00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
of our dance party mode they've gone to
plaid


00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.389 align:start position:0%
[Music]


00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
as you can see we can make you dance
 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
till you drop
